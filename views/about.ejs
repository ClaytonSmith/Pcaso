	    <i>Paint a new datascape</i>
	  </h2>
	  <p>
	    <b>To make an <a href="http://www.pcaso.io/mundo" target="_blank">interactive datascape</a>, <a href="http://www.pcaso.io/signin" target="_blank">sign in</a> to Pcaso and click the <i>Paint new datascape</i> button. Then just upload a .csv file*, pick fields to show as axes, or ID/other metadata, add a caption if you like, and set the datascape as public (viewable by anyone) or private (viewable only by you and anyone else you invite). You’ll instantly get a datascape to explore and share as you wish.</p>
	  <small>
	    *Use a <i>Windows-formatted</i> .csv, e.g., as exported from Mac or Windows Excel via the <i>Save as</i> dropdown. And keep
	    numeric data in standard decimal (not scientific/exponential) notation.
	  </small>
	  

	  <h2><i>Explore a datascape</i></h2>
	  <p>After opening a datascape, click any small plot to see it big. Click any metaclass (listed next to the plots) to recolor points by that kind of underlying data. Hover on a point in the big plot to see its metadata. And to highlight particular points that interest you, either
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>click a value for the currently chosen metaclass</li>
	    <li>search by text box to find points by <i>any</i> matching metadata</li>
	    <li>click or click-drag one or more points in the big plot</li>
	  </ul>

	  <h2><i>Share a datascape</i></h2>
	  <p>You can drop any <i>public</i> datascape’s URL into an email, text, tweet, research manuscript (great for <a href="http://biorxiv.org" target="_blank">preprints</a>), carrier pigeon, etc. Giving a talk with data? You can fluidly walk through the public datascape, on- or (once loaded in your browser window) off-line, and show your listeners the URL to explore live on their own.</p>
	  <p>To more selectively share a <i>private</i> datascape in your Pcaso.io portfolio, you can invite someone to come see it by adding their email address to the <i>Share privately with</i> list for that datascape.
	    
	    <h2><i>Remix or delete a datascape</i></h2>
	  <p>To change the basic axes, metadata, or caption for a datascape in your Pcaso.io portfolio, click the gear icon by its title, change settings as desired, and click <i>Update datascape</i> to see the new version. To change the title (which determines a datascape's URL), for now you must reupload the underlying data, to paint it with a new title.</p>
	  <p>To delete your datascape, click the gear icon by its title, then click the <i>Delete datascape</i> button.</p>
	  
	  <h2><b>Why <span class="pcaso"></span> beats paper</b></h2>
	  <p>We people see, and think, in too few dimensions to easily understand complex data with many variables.</p>
	  <p>Conventionally, we’ve frozen such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_cloud" target="_blank">point cloud</a> data flat, to view as dots
	    scattered in the plane of a page or screen, perhaps varying by color or size to say a bit more. This convention can help spotlight one pattern...only
	    to hide those lurking in other dimensions. And while adding plots to see other angles or metadata can help a bit,
	    <i>in the end, static plots can’t readily show which dots in one view of a point cloud correspond to which in another – a key question in probing complex data.</i>
	  </p>
	  <p>To help understand many kinds of such data, in genomics and other fields, we built the <i>Point cloud analysis stereopticon</i>
	    (<span class="pcaso"></span>), an easy way to collaboratively explore planar views
	    (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis" target="_blank">PCA</a>,
	    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scalingMDS" target="_blank">MDS</a>, comparative abundance, &amp;c.) of data with many variables.
	    <span class="pcaso"></span> lets you fluidly explore point cloud data posted by others – and easily make your own informatively responsive
	    <a href="http://www.pcaso.io/miller" target="_blank">datascape</a> to drop into a paper, talk, or tweet for others to explore.</p>
	  <p>Crucially, <span class="pcaso"></span> transcends key limitations of static plots, letting you
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>informatively explore data in a responsive, shareable <a href="http://www.pcaso.io/mundo" target="_blank">datascape</a></li>
	    <li>smoothly switch views of the data, <i>to track how each point shifts relative to others, among potentially many dimensions</i></li>
	    <li>instantly recolor, highlight, and see more about points by clicking listed metadata, hovering or clicking on points, or text-searching all metadata</li>
	    <li>smoothly zoom, to see patterns big and small</li>
	    <li>caption a datascape to explain details, invite contact, &amp;c.</li>
	  </ul>
	  

	  <h2>Burning questions</h2>
	  <p><i>What kinds of data does <span class="pcaso"></span> help with?</i></p>
	  <p>Basically, anything with up to 20 thousand or so datapoints, in several to many numeric dimensions, with (ideally) several kinds of categorical or other metadata. Could be principal components, of course – but lots of other data can benefit from smoothly switchable, metadata-responsive planar views. If you’ve got such data, try it out.</p>
	  <p><i>Does <span class="pcaso"></span> itself run PCA (or otherwise statistically analyze data)?</i></p>
	  <p>No. We aimed first to help explore and share many-dimension data that you (or others) have already generated, via a simple exchange format (.csv), knowing that many folks prefer to crunch rawer numbers with varied, question-tuned methods and software. Over time, we may build stats directly into <span class="pcaso"></span> – so stay tuned.</p>
	  <p><i>Will you mine, rent, or sell the data I upload?</i></p>
	  <p>No.</p>
	  <p><i>How robust is <span class="pcaso"></span>?</i></p>
	  <p>We’ve started with a beta hosted on a good standard web server, with basic features to spark collaborative insights – not (yet) to specially encrypt data or stop determined bad actors. Please use <span class="pcaso"></span> responsibly.</p>
	  <p><i>What about parallel-coordinate plots?</i></p>
	  <p>They too can help a lot, by showing many dimensions (especially qualitative or naturally ordered ones) at once. But following tangled curves, and spotting
	    correlations between coordinates shown far apart, can be tough.</p>
	  <p><i>Why not show a 3d box instead of planes?</i></p>
	  <p>We started with planes that mean something real from underlying data, and that our brains can easily track when switching axes. (Plus, for data with many axes,
	    a box shows little more of the whole than a plane does.)</p>
	  <p><i>But doesn’t a stereopticon show 3d images?</i></p>
	  <p>That’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscope" target="_blank">stereoscope</a> ;-) In steampunk days,
	    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereopticon" target="_blank">stereopticons</a> just let people switch from one slide to another. We were also inspired by
	    <a href="https://www.mdc.edu/wolfson/Academic/ArtsLetters/art_philosophy/Humanities/Cubism/cubism%20front2.htm" target="_blank">cubists</a>
	    (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso" target="_blank">Picasso</a>, of course) who splintered complex real-world shapes into many-planar views,
	    to convey them more deeply.</p>
	  
	  <h2>Coming features</h2>
	  <p>We hope to soon let you see simple regression or/and cluster analysis on plots, to better spot meaningful patterns -- along with other handy features, elaborated by us and others via CC0-licensed d3+ code, to help manage and interpret diverse complex, plane-projected datasets.
